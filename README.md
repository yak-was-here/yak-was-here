## Development

### Setup

#### nvm

Install nvm or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) and make sure to leave the "Open with PowerShell" option checked so that it updates the environment variables after installation. Then make sure to fully restart the editor + terminal(s) after installation.

Use the correct version of node+npm:

```sh
# See what version of Node needs to be installed
cat .nvmrc
```

```sh
# Install and use the version from above
nvm install 22 && nvm use 22
```

#### Dependencies

Install packages:

```sh
npm i
```

### Updating packages

Update a specific package:

```sh
./nx migrate <package-name>@<version>
```

Update all packages:

```sh
# Updates the versions of the relevant packages in the package.json file
# Generates a migrations.json if there are pending migrations
./nx migrate latest
```

### Troubleshooting

# OR
npx nx <command>

```
