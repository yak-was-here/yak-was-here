summary: 'This soundboard uses JavaScript to play and stop HTML5 audio elements via preset keybinds. It was made to add sound effects to my church''s VBS skits. The sounds include a VBS theme song made by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/337_productions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">337</a>, scene soundscapes, and sound effects. Preset audio files, collected from freesound.org, are loaded via HTML5 semantic audio elements and triggered by JavaScript keybinds. This was made in a couple hours, but if I made it again I would probably add volume control, make it mobile-friendly, and add a way to load custom sounds for future reusability.'
