summary: "A CSS background property randomizer capable of transitioning between images, colors, and gradients, written with vanilla JavaScript. This tool is published on NPM. I wrote this because I wanted smooth background image transitions on an old version of my personal website. I ended up adding support for every background property type. In the future, I may take some time to address a couple of small bugs, optimize the code, and add CommonJS support."
